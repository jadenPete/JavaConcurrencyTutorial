/*
 * The task:
 *
 * For this assignment, you should write a program that accepts three pieces of user input:
 * - A number of threads
 * - An integer starting number
 * - An integer ending number
 *
 * The program should compute the product of all the numbers between the starting and ending number,
 * exclusive, and print the result. Furthermore, it should divide the work as evenly as possible
 * between a number of spawned threads equal to the first inputted number.
 *
 * As a bonus, try providing different numbers of threads. How does the performance of the program
 * vary with the number of threads? (Hint: use the `time` command to figure this out). From this,
 * can you draw any conclusions about what the optimal number of threads is?
